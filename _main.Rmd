# About {-}

This is an independent study of the text **Bayesian Data Analysis** by Andrew Gelman and the more introductory text **A First Course In Bayesian Statistical Methods** by Peter D. Hoff.  We will read through most of the chapters and typeset the major definitions.  The Gelman text can be difficult, and for difficult chapters, we will lean more on the Hoff textbook.   


## Independent study {-}

We will typeset each chapter of the Gelman text book, unless the chapter is too difficult, then we will use the introductory text **A First Course In Bayesian Statistical Methods** by Hoff.  Each chapter will summarize the definitions, and attempt several problems selected.

## Supervised learning {-}
Dr. Paul Marjoram will supervise the learning and have a general oversight to the learning process.

# Fundamentals of Bayesian Inference

The first few chapters of Gelman's text are introductory, and we attempt to highlight the key definitions and summarize each chapter. At the end of each chapter we attempt several problems.  Probability and inference is defined using three steps

1. setting up the full probability model for a joint distribution for all observable and unobservable quantities.
2. Conditioning on observed data: computing the appropriate *posterior* distribution, the conditional probability distribution of the unobserved quantities of oltimate interest, given the observed data.
3. Evaluating the fit of the model.

## General notation for statistical inference

There are two different kinds of estimands, the first are potentially observable quantities, such as future observations of a process, and the second are quantities that are not directly observable, namely the parameters that govern a process being investigated.  

### Exchangeability {-}
One key assumption is that the n values $y_i$ are regarded as *exchangeable*, meaning that the uncertainty can be expressed as a joint probability $p(y_1,...,y_n)$ that is invariant to permutations of indexes.  Often times the exchangeable distribution is modeled as *iid*.

### Explanatory variables {-}
It is common to have observations on each unit which have non-random variables called *explanatory variables* or *covariates*.  The explanatory variables are usually denoted by X.  However treating X as random then exchangeability can be extended $(x,y)_i$ which is invariant to permutations of the indexes.  Further, it is always appropriate to assume exchangeability of y, conditioned on sufficient information of X, where the indexes can be thought of as randomly assigned.  It follows that if two units have the same value of x, then the distributions of y are the same.

### Hierarchical modeling {-}
for a model across patients across different cities, we can assume exchangability to patients within a city.  Further conditioned on the explanatory variables at the individual, the conditional distribution given these explanatory variables would be exchangeable.


## Bayesian inference
The prior, p($\theta$), and the sampling distribution, or the *data distribution*, $p(y|\theta)$ is related to the joint distribution by

$$ p(\theta,y) = p(\theta)p(y | \theta)$$

Where using Bayes' rule the posterior distribution 
\begin{equation}
p(\theta | y ) = \frac{p(\theta)p(y| \theta)}{p(y)}
(\#eq:bayes)
\end{equation}

Where $p(y)  = \int p(\theta)p(y | \theta)d\theta$, or a sum in discrete case.  An equivalent form of \@ref(eq:bayes) is the *unnormalized posterior density* given as

\begin{equation}
p(\theta | y ) \propto p(\theta)p(y | \theta)
(\#eq:unnorm)
\end{equation}

Note that $p(y | \theta)$ is taken as a function of $\theta$, not of y.

## Prediction {-}
Inferences about an unknown *observable* variable, are called predictive inferences.  Before the data y are considered, the distribution of the unknown, observable, y is $$ p(y) = \int p(y,\theta)d\theta = \int p(\theta)p(y | \theta)d\theta$$

this is defined as the marginal distribution of y, and also called *prior predictive distribution*.  Prior refers that the data is not conditional on any previous observation, and predictive refers to the data being observable.

The *posterior predictive distribution* is conditional on the observed y, but is predictive because it is predicting observable values.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
p(\hat{y} | y) &= \int p(\hat{y}, \theta | y) d\theta \\
&= \int p(\hat{y} |\theta, y) p(\theta|y) d\theta \\
& = \int p(\hat{y}| \theta) p(\theta | y) d\theta \\
\end{split}
(\#eq:postpred)
\end{equation}

## Likelihood {-}
The data *y* affects the posterior inference only through \@ref(eq:unnorm) likelihood function $p(y| \theta)$ which is regarded as a function of $\theta$ for fixed y.  The *likelihood function* is defined as $p(y | \theta)$, and the *likelihood principle* is for any given sample, and any two likelihood models $p(y | \theta)$, two models with the same likelihood will have the same inference for $\theta$.

## Subjectivity and Objectivity {-}

The frequentist models, MLEs, have subjectivity in their assumptions because they rely on long sequence of identical trials, that are iid.  The Bayesian model relies on the prior distribution.  If any experiment is repeatable and can replicated, the the prior distribution can be estimated from the data themselves and the analysis is more 'objective'.  Replication increases objectivity of a given model.  However the Bayesian approach allows for (1) the ability to combine information from multiple sources (allowing for greater objectivity) and (2) more encompassing by accounting for uncertainity about the unknowns in a statistical problem.

It is important to include as much background information as possible 

## Exercises

1.  Suppose for $\theta=1$, then y$\sim N(1,\sigma)$, and if $\theta=2, y\sim N(2,\sigma)$.  Where P($\theta=1)=P(\theta=2)=0.5$.
    (a)  For $\sigma=2$; we must write the formula for the pdf of y.   $p(y) = \sum_\theta p(y|\theta)p(\theta) = (1/2)N(1,\sigma^2)+ (1/2)N(2,\sigma^2)$ as the marginal density.
```{r}
 fy<-function(y) {return(0.5*dnorm(y,mean=1,sd=2)+0.5*dnorm(y,2,sd=2))}    
```

    (b) $P(\theta=1 | y=1) = \frac{p(\theta=1)p(y|\theta=1)}{p(y)}= \frac{(1/2)N(1,4)}{(1/2)N(1,\sigma^2)+ (1/2)N(2,\sigma^2)}$ = 0.53 
    
```{r}
dy<-function(y){ return( (1/2)*dnorm(y,mean=1,sd=2)/fy(y))}
dy(1)
```


4. twelve games with point spread of 8 points.
    (a) Using relative frequency, P(favorite wins $|$ point spread =8) = 0.67.  
    P(favorite wins by at least 8 $|$ point spread =8) = 0.42.  
    and P(fav. wins by at least 8 $|$ spread =8, favorite team wins) = 0.62.
```{r} 
spread<-8

## outcome of the games favor score - underdog score
 games<-c(-7,-5,-3,-3,1,6,7,13,15,16,20,21)
## frequentist approach
 fav.wins<-  mean(games>0)
 message(paste0("(frequentist): fav wins: ", round(fav.wins,2)))
 fav.by.8<- mean((games>8))
  message(paste0("(frequentist): fav wins by 8: ", round(fav.by.8,2)))

  ## P( fav. wins >8 | fav. wins) = P(fav. wins > 8, fav. wins )/ P(fav. wins)
 cond<-sum(games>8 & games>0)/sum(games>0)   
  c<-fav.by.8/fav.wins
 message(paste0("(frequentist): fav wins by 8 given fav. wins: ", round(cond,2)))
```

  (b) now  we assume a normal distribution with $d|x \sim N(-1.25, 10.10)$.  So $P(d > -x)= P(Z\sigma+\mu > -x)=P(Z > -x-\mu / \sigma)$
  (i) Probablity fav team wins is 0.75
  (ii) fav team wins by 8 (beats the spread) is 0.45, we expect this to be 0.5 (the middle of the normal distribution because we centered on the spread)
  (iii) P(wins by 8 $|$ favorite team wins) = P(favorite team wins $|$ wins by 8)P(wins by 8)/P(favorite team wins) = P(wins by 8)/P(fav. team wins) since the conditional prob. =1 given the favorite team wins.  The prob. that they win by at least 8 is 0.6.
```{r}
## part b
  d<-games-8
  sample.mean <-mean(d)
  sample.sd<-sd(d)
  ## assume  d|x ~ N(0,10.10)
  fav.wins.norm<- 1-pnorm(-8,mean=sample.mean,sd=sample.sd)
   message(paste0("(normal): fav wins: ", round(fav.wins.norm,2)))

  fav.by.8.norm<-1-pnorm(0,mean=sample.mean,sd=sample.sd)
    message(paste0("(normal): fav wins by 8: ", round(fav.by.8.norm,2)))
## Pr(Wins by 8 | Fav. wins) = P(Fav. wins | wins by 8)P(wins by 8) / P(fav. wins)
    ## P(Fav. wins | wins by 8) = 1
  cond.norm<-fav.by.8.norm/fav.wins.norm
   message(paste0("(normal): fav wins by 8 given fav. wins: ", round(cond.norm,2)))

```
5. We need to estimate the probability that there is at least one congressional election that is tied in the next U.S. election.  There are 435 senate elections.
    (a)  The parameters of interest are $\theta_i$ the true probability that the election is tied.  We can let the *prior* $\theta \sim  Beta(\alpha,\beta)$.  The *likelihood* is $y|\theta_i \sim Binomial(435,\theta_i) = \theta^{\sum y_i}(1-\theta)^{435-\sum y_i}$ follows a Binomial distribution (ignoring the binomial coefficient) where we assume each election is independent. Hence the posterior for theta $f(\theta | y) \sim Beta(\sum y_i +\alpha, n-\sum y_i +\beta)$. where $\alpha,\beta$ are set to 1 for the uniform prior.  For this case we set $\alpha, \beta$ equal to 1, 10 which has a prior mean of 0.09.
    
```{r}
theta=seq(from=0,to=1,by=.01)
plot(theta,dbeta(theta,1,10),type='l')
```

(b)  In the period of 1900-1992, there were 20,597 elections, out of which 6 were decided by less than 10 votes,  and 49 were decided by less than 100 votes.  
      we can estimate the probability of a tie to be less than 6/20,597 and bounded by 49/20,597.  So for the Binomial trials the sum of the successes is 6, and n=20,597, so the posterior could be $\theta | y \sim Beta(1+6, 10+20,597 -6)$ is the posterior for $\theta$.  This assumes that 10 votes is within the neighborhood of an election tie.   
      The question asks to compute at least one election tie, from a total of 435 elections.  This follows a Binomial(435, $\hat{\theta})$. Where we use the posterior mean to estimate $\theta$.  The posterior mean using the Beta(7,20601) yields a mean of $\hat{\theta}=\frac{7}{20608} = 3.4e-04$ as the posterior mean.
      
      
  Then the probability that at least 1 election is tied, from 435 total elections will  follow a Binomial(435, $\hat{\theta})$, where we can use the posterior distribution for $\theta | y$ in the Binomial likelihood $P(X\geq 1 | \hat{\theta})= 1-P(X\leq0 | \hat{\theta})$  which has a probability of 0.14 of at least 1 election tie.
```{r}
 # the posterior for theta is Beta(1+6,10+20597-6)
 plot(theta,dbeta(theta,7,10+20597-6),type='l')

 ## posterior mean is 7/(20601)
## then P(X>=1) = 1-P(X<=0 | p)
  1-pbinom(0,435,prob=7/20608)
```

9. A clinic has three doctors.  Patients come into the clinic at random, starting at 9 a.m. according to a Poisson process, with a time parameter, t, of 10 minutes; that is after opening the first patient appears follows an exponential distribution with average waiting time of 10 minutes. Then the next patient arrives with a waiting time of an expected 10 minutes as iid exponential distribution.  After a patient arrives, the patient waits until a doctor is available, and the doctor visits a patitient uniformly between 5-20 minutes.  The clinic stops admitting patients at 4 pm, and closes after the last patient is completed with the visit.

   (a) Simulate this process once. how many patients visited the office? how many had to wait for a doctor? what was the average wait? when did office close?

# Single parameter models {#cross}

## Estimating a probability from binomial data

\begin{equation}
p(y  | \theta) = {n \choose y}\theta^y(1-\theta)^{n-y}
(\#eq:binomialProb)
\end{equation}

To perform Bayesian inference we assume $\theta \sim U(0,1)$ where the posterior is 

\begin{equation}
p(\theta | y) \propto \theta^y(1-\theta)^{n-y}
(\#eq:binomialPosterior)
\end{equation}

which is the form of a `beta` distribution $\theta | y \sim Beta(y+1, n-y+1)$

## Posterior as a compromise between data and prior information
 The posterior is less variable than the prior because it incorporates the information from the data.
 
\begin{equation}
E(\theta) = E(E(\theta | y))
(\#eq:adamsLaw)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
V(\theta) = E(V(\theta|y)) + V(E(\theta | y))
(\#eq:evesLaw)
\end{equation}
 
where $\theta|y$ is the posterior.  So the average of the prior, is the average of the posterior means over the distribution of possible data.  The variance of the prior \@ref(eq:evesLaw) says the posterior variance is on average smaller than the prior variance.

## Summarizing the posterior inference
The mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of the posterior distribution summarize the all the current information about a model.  

### Posterior quantiles and intervals{-}

The posterior uncertainty can be reported by presenting the quantiles of the posterior distribution.  The interval, a *central interval of posterior probability* corresponds to the case of 100($1-\alpha)\%$, to the range of values above and below which lies exactly 100($\alpha/2)\%$ of the posterior probability.  The interval estimates are *posterior intervals*.  This differences from the confidence interval because the confidence interval is not a probability interval, because either the parameter is within the region or it is not, but the confidence interval provides information in the long run over repeated experimentation as to how many experiments would contain the true parameter.

There is also the *highest posterior interval* which is a probabilistic interval that is not less than any region outside of the interval.

## Informative prior distributions

the property that the posterior distribution follows the same parametric form as the prior distribution is called *conjugacy*.  Where the beta prior distribution is a *conjugate family* for the binomial likelihood.  

so given the binomial likelihood $p(y|\theta)\propto \theta^a(1-\theta)^b$, and a prior density $p(\theta)\propto \theta^{\alpha-1}(1-\theta)^{\beta-1}$ the posterior is of the beta family.


$$
\begin{aligned}
 p(\theta | y) &\propto \theta^y(1-\theta)^{n-y}\theta^{\alpha-1}(1-\theta)^{\beta-1}\\
 &= \theta^{y+\alpha-1}(1-\theta)^{n-y+\beta-1}\\
 &= Beta(\theta | \alpha+y, \beta+n-y)
\end{aligned}
$$


### Conjugate prior distributions{-}
Conjugacy is formally defined as if F is a class of sampling distributions $p(y|\theta)$, and P is a class of prior distributions for $\theta$, then the class P is conjugate for F if $p(\theta | y) \in P$ for all $p(.|\theta)\in F$ and $p(.)\in P$.

### Conjugate prior, distributions, exponential families, and sufficient statistics{-}
Posterior distributions can be derived using sufficient statistics from exponential families.  The exponential family is defined as 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 p(y_i | \theta)=f(y_i)g(\theta)e^{\phi(\theta)^Tu(y_i)}
\end{aligned}
$$
Where $\phi(\theta), u(y_i)$ are vectors of equal dimension to that of $\theta$.  The $\phi(\theta)$ is called the *natural parameter* for the family (F).  The likelihood of a sequence $y=(y_1,...,y_n)$ iid is

$$
\begin{aligned}
 p(y | \theta)&= (\prod_{i=1}^n f(y_i)) g(\theta)^n exp(\phi(\theta)^T \sum_{i=1}^n u(y_i)) \\
  &\propto g(\theta)^ne^{\phi(\theta)^Tt(y)}, t(y)=\sum_{y=1}^n u(y_i)
\end{aligned}
$$

The *sufficient statistic* for $\theta$ is $t(y)$ because the likelihood for $\theta depends on the data, y, only through the value of t(y).

Sufficient statistics benefit posterior distributions because if the prior density is specified as 
$$
\begin{aligned}
 p(\theta)&\propto g(\theta)^{\eta} e^{\phi(\theta)^T \nu} \\
 \end{aligned}
$$
Then the posterior density using sufficient statistics is

$$
\begin{aligned}
 p(\theta | y ) &\propto g(\theta)^{\eta+n} e^{\phi(\theta)^T (\nu+t(y))} \\
 \end{aligned}
$$

Exponential families are the only classes of distributions that have natural conjugate prior distributions. 

## Normal distribution with known variance

The normal distribution is foundational to statistical modeling, with the central limit theorem (CLT) allowing for the use of normal likelihood in many statistical problems which can approximate complex likelihoods.  If the normal distribution does not provide a good model fit, finite mixtures of distributions can identify useful solutions.

### Likelihood of one data point{-}

With mean $\theta$ and known variance $\sigma^2$ the sampling distribution of a given point is defined 

$p(y|\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2*\pi*\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} (y-\theta)^2}$

### Conjugate prior and posterior distributions
The prior has the exponential family form given as $\theta \sim N(\mu_0, \tau_0^2)$


$$
\begin{aligned}
 p(\theta ) &\propto exp( \frac{1}{2\tau_0^2}(\theta-\mu_0)^2) \\
 \end{aligned}
$$

WHere completing the square can find the posterior distribution

$$
\begin{aligned}
 p(\theta | y ) &\propto exp(-1/2(\frac{(y-\theta)^2}{\sigma^2} +\frac{(\theta-\mu_0)^2}{\tau_0^2} )  ) \\
 p(\theta | y ) &\propto exp( \frac{1}{2\tau_1^2}(\theta-\mu_1)^2),  \theta|y \sim N(\mu_1,\tau_1^2)
 \end{aligned}
$$
where $\mu_1 = \frac{1/\tau_0^2 \mu_0 + 1/\sigma^2 y}{1/\tau_0^2 + 1/\sigma^2}$ and $1/\tau_1^2 = 1/\tau_0^2 +1/\sigma^2$

In manipulating the distributions the inverse of the variance is defined as the *precision*.  The posterior precision is equal to the prior precision plus the data precision.  And the posterior mean is a weighted average of the prior mean and the observed value, y, proportional to the total precision.

### Posterior predictive distribution{-}

the posterior predictive distribution of a future observation, x, p(x|y) can be calculated 

$$
\begin{aligned}
p(x|y) &= \int p(x|\theta)p(\theta|y) d\theta
&\propto \int exp(-1/2\sigma^2 (x-\theta)^2) exp(-1/2\tau_1^2 (\theta-\mu_1)^2) d\theta
\end{aligned}
$$
 the future observations, x, does not depend on the past observations y given $\theta$.  


### Normal model with multiple observations{-}

For multiple observations, y, the posterior density is formulated as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 p(\theta | y ) &\propto p(\theta)p(y|\theta) \\
   &=p(\theta)\prod_i p(y_i | \theta)\\
   &\propto exp(-1/2\tau_0^2 (\theta-\mu_0)^2)\prod_i exp(-1/2\sigma^2 (y_i -\theta)^2)\\
   &\propto exp(-1/2 (1/\tau_0^2(\theta-\mu_0)^2+ 1/\sigma^2\sum_i(y_i-\theta)^2) )\\
 \end{aligned}
$$
Simplfying the algebra shows the posterior depends on y only through the sample mean (sufficient statistic), $\bar{y}$ is the sufficient statistic for $\theta$, and the final model is $\bar{y} | \theta,\sigma^2 \sim N(\theta, \sigma^2/n)$

## Exercises

### Question 1{-}
prior Beta(4,4), where a coin is tossed 10 times and heads appears fewer than 3 times.  the exact posterior is Beta(4+y, 4+10-y) for y=0,1,2.  Since we don't know the observed heads, but that $y<3$ we plot the posterior distributions for each possibility.  For 2 heads it is closer to the prior, with posterior mean of 0.33,  which is closest to the prior mean of 1/2.

The random event is that $Y=(0,1,2)$ and we sum all possibilities for the total likelihood.

The likelihood of the total event is $\theta^0(1-\theta)^{10}+\binom{10}{1}\theta(1-\theta)^9+\binom{10}{2}\theta^2(1-\theta)^8$

the posterior is  $\theta^3(1-\theta)^{13}+\binom{10}{1}\theta^4(1-\theta)^{12}+\binom{10}{2}\theta^5(1-\theta)^{11}$

### Question 3{-}


The prior predictive distributions for the number of 6's in a fair roll, tossed 1,000 times will follow a beta distribution.  Let y be the number of 6's in 1000 rolls of fair die, the probability for a 6 is 1/6, so the number of 6's (successes) in this trial is approximateley 167, and 833 failures as the prior prediction. with probabiliy of success (1/6).  

We plot the beta distribution of the expected number of heads in 1000 tosses.  

The normal approximation for the prior prediction uses the binomial distribution is $\mu = n*p = 167$ and $\sigma^2 = npq $=  138.89 $\sim N(167, 138.89)$



The normal approximation shows the probability of heads in a given 1000  tosses, using a non-informative prior beta(167,833) which has a prior predictive mean of $exp(-1.79)/(1+exp(-1.79)) = 0.143$.  This is not the same for number of success in 1000 tosses.  

We find the probability distribution of a given success and the prior probability predictive interval follows a beta with 95% (0.12,0.17) for hte probability of rolling a 6

### Question 4{-}
We have a mixture of 3 normal distributions, and show the central intervals for 5,25,50,75, and 95$\%$ predictive probabilities.  The question gives $\theta$ as the probability of a 6 on a die, possibly unfair, in 1,000 tosses.  we have $\theta= 1/12,1/6, 1/4$ types of biased die. Using the normal approximation, the predictive prior probability is $\sum_{\theta}p(\theta)p(y| \theta)$ where the likelihood is approximated using a normal distribution $\mu = n*\theta_i, \sigma = n*\theta_i(1-\theta_i)$

### Question 8 (Normal distribution with unknown mean){-}
A random sample of n students is drawn from a large population, and weights are measured.  The average height of the n sampled students is $\bar{y}= 150$ lbs.  Assume the weights in the population are normally distribution with unknown mean, $\theta$, and known standard deviation 20 lbs.  Suppose the prior for $\theta \sim N(180, 40^2)$

For known variance, the limit of the posterior is $p(\theta,y)\approx N(\theta| \bar{y}, \sigma^2/n)$.  And the direct formulation is $p(\theta | \bar{y})= N(\theta | \mu_n,\tau_n^2).$ using equations 2.12.

For a posterior predictive interval, the marginal distribution for new data $p(\tilde{y}  | y) \sim N(\mu_n, \sigma^2+\tau_n^2)$

### Question 11{-}
suppose y1,...,y5 are iid Cauchy($\theta,1$) r.vs. and the prior distribution for$\theta \sim U[0,100]$.  the given observations are y=43,44,45,46.5,47.5.

- (a) compute the unnormalized posterior density on a grid of points $\theta=0 1/m, 2/m, ... 100$.  using the grid approximation, compute and plot the posterior density as a function of $\theta$

for the likelihood  $L(\theta | y) = \prod_{i=1}^n f(y_i|\theta)$ requires the product of $y$ for a given theta. this was a mistake i made in the first attempt.  The posterior is $p(\theta|y) = L(\theta |y)p(\theta)$  wher p($\theta)= 1/100$

- (b) Sample 1000 draws from theta from posterior density and plot histogram
we sample from theta [0,100] using the grid approximation, and the probability is from the posterior distribution.

  ##sample mean is close to the mean of the observed.

```
- (c) Using the previous 1000 samples of $\theta$ to obtain 1000 samples from the predictive distribution of a future observation $y_6$, and plot the predictive draws.
we use the sampled thetas from the posterior to sample from the Cauchy distribution.  The predictive probability follows $p(x|y) =\int p(x|\theta)p(\theta|y)d\theta$ where $p(x|\theta)$ follows from the Cauchy distribution, given original sequence of thetas.  We have the posterior values for each theta (given the uniform grid of thetas) and take the product.  then for each predictive value, we sum the total probability across all thetas to compute the predictive probability.  The maximum predictive value probability 0.52 with probability of 0.29.

### Question 12{-}
Suppose $y|\theta \sim Poisson(\theta)$, find Jeffreys' prior density for $\theta$ and then find $\alpha,\beta$ for which Gamma(a,b) density is a close match to Jeffreys' density.

$$
\begin{aligned}
 log(p(y|\theta))&= y*log(\theta)-\theta -log(y!)\\
 &\implies y' = y/\theta - 1 ,  y'' = -y/\theta^2 \\
 &\implies J(\theta)= E(- l'')= E(y/\theta^2)= 1/\theta \\
 &= p(\theta)\propto |J(\theta)^{1/2}| = \sqrt{1/\theta} = \theta^{-1/2}\\
\end{aligned}
$$
 So the closes prior is $\alpha=1/2 , \beta=0$.

### Question 13{-}
- (a) Use the normal approximation to gamma and poisson to determine a posterior for fatal accidents using table 2.2.  Compute the 95$\%$ predictive interval.

- We set the empirical prior alpha =25 and beta =1 because the effective sample size ($\beta$) is mean is approximately 25, and given these the quantiles of the prior distribution is 16.2 and 35.7 which contains the observed data well. and the prior mean is approximately 25 which is reasonably close to the table 2.2 values, although a sensitivity analysis is recommended.

- We use the conjugate prior for Gamma to find the posterior distribution, which closely is approximated by the normal distribution.  The posterior distributions are similar.   The normal approximation prior followed $N(\alpha/\beta, \sqrt{\alpha}/\beta)$.  we set the variance to be known $\sigma^2=100$.   Using the gamma conjugate prior the predictive interval is $95\% $ (21.1,26.9).

- The posterior predictive value was determined by sample values from the posterior, and using the parameters sampled from posterior to generate a Poisson random variable.  The average predictive value is 23.9 fatal accidents.     


-Using Jeffrey's prior we set alpha=1/2 and beta=0.02  which has a prior mean of 25 which matches the observed mean.  The posterior using Jeffreys' prior credible interval 95$\%$ is (21.11, 26.88) which is similar to the empirical prior.  Using the normal approximation to Jeffreys' prior has a 95$\%$ predictive interval of (14,34) with a predictive mean of 23.83.  The posterior predictive value for 1986 was computed by sampling $\theta$ from the posterior distribution, and for each $\theta_j$, we sampled a random variable from Poisson($\lambda=\theta_j)$.

-Using Jeffreys' prior, the posteror is $p(\theta|y) \sim Gamma(238.5,10.2)$.  Using simulation the $95\%$ predictive invterval is (14,34).  Using the normal approximation 
- Using the posterior predictiction equation  $E(x|y) = E(\theta| y) = \mu$.  and the V($x|y)= E(\theta| y)+ V(\theta | y)$.  Using the normal approximation $\mu_n = 23.8$ and $\tau_n^2 = 9.9$.  Then the posterior variance is  23.8+9.9 = 33.7.  Then using $\mu \pm 1.96\sigma_n = (12.43 35.19)$.
The true observed value for 1986 is 22 fatal accidents.

- (b) Assume fatal accidents follow a Poisson distribution with a constant rate and an exposure in each year proportional to the number of passanger miles flown.  Set a prior and determine a posterior and predictive distribution.  estimate the number of passanger miles flown in each year by dividing

let $\theta$ be the fatal accidents *rate* per 100,000 million miles flown.  and let $x_i$ be the number per 100,000 million miles flown.   We compute the miles by dividing the passenger deaths divided by the death rate (deaths per 100,000 million miles flown).

We then compute the fatal accident rate by computing the (passanger deaths per 100,000 million miles)*(number of fatal accidents / number of passenger deaths).  We let $\theta$ = fatal accidents per 100 million miles flown.

The mean accident rate is 0.004, so we set alpha =5 and beta = 1000,  so the prior mean is 0.005 (95$\%$: 0.002,0.01) which is similar to the observed ranges.  This is using the observed data to create an empirically driven prior.

However, we must use the Jeffreys' prior for a non-informative prior setting $\alpha=0.01, \beta=0.01$.

Using Jeffreys' prior, the posterior is Gamma(238.01, 5.716e12) with a 95 credible interval of (3.65e-11, 4.71e-11).

Now for the posterior predictive value, because the parameters space is so small, we sample $\theta$ from $p(\theta | y)$ Gamma posterior to generate $\theta$.  In the previous exercise, we used theta from a uniform sequence, but these values are so small due to the scaling it is easier to sample directly from the posterior using `rgamma`.  THen we find the predictive value $x \sim Pois(8e11*\theta_j)$ by random sampling observation variables from the posterior, and sorting them for the 95 predictive interval.

We can also use the normal approximation, but the equations for the mean and variance must be scaled by the factor 8e11.

- (c) we repeat part (a) but for passenger deaths.  we need to find a prior and determine the posterior distribution with a predictive interval.

We used an empirically derived prior, which does not match the solution, and so we include Jeffreys' prior setting $\alpha=1/2, \beta=0.01$.

 Note that the death rate mean is not equal to the variance so the performance is not as good compared to the fatal accidents.  
 
 The 1986 prediction mean is 692 $95\%$ (638, 750) using the empirical derived priors estimated from the data.  
 If we use Jeffreys' prior the prediction interval is (638,741.05).
 
 which is not the expected prediction of 546 passenger deaths.  This is likely because Poisson is not a good fit because it is constrained.

### Question 21
estimate percentage of adult population in each state (excluding alaska and hawaii) who label themselves as very liberal.  plot estimate vs. obama's vote share in 2008.

For each state we measure $y_j\sim Pois(n_j\theta_j)$ from section 2.7 where y is the number of adult population who identify themselves as *very liberal* in ideology for a given state.    

we do not have population of each state, but we do have the number of respondents of each state, and denote $n_j$ as the integer representing the total respondents.

Alternatively, we do have census density category for each state (1-5) which can account for the populaiton density. 


- (a) graph the proportion of liberal in each state vs obama vote share.  here the proportion of liberal votes was weighted by the total respondents

we see that the highest proportion of very liberal polls is associated with the states with the highest obama percentage of votes in CA, NY, WA, and IL.  Conversely we see that WY UT, OK are very red states with low polls in very liberal voters, with the lowest support for obama.  

For those that identify as *liberal* we see a much linear trend.

# Parts

You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together. Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. 

Add a numbered part: `# (PART) Act one {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`)

Add an unnumbered part: `# (PART\*) Act one {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`)

Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: `# (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.

## Equations

Here is an equation.

\begin{equation} 
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}
  (\#eq:binom)
\end{equation} 

You may refer to using `\@ref(eq:binom)`, like see Equation \@ref(eq:binom).


## Theorems and proofs

Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using `\@ref(thm:tri)`, for example, check out this smart theorem \@ref(thm:tri).

::: {.theorem #tri}
For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the *length* of the hypotenuse
and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the **other** two sides, we have
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

# Sharing your book

## Publishing

HTML books can be published online, see: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/publishing.html

## 404 pages

By default, users will be directed to a 404 page if they try to access a webpage that cannot be found. If you'd like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a `_404.Rmd` or `_404.md` file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax.

## Metadata for sharing

Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the `index.Rmd` YAML. To setup, set the `url` for your book and the path to your `cover-image` file. Your book's `title` and `description` are also used.



This `gitbook` uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same.

Specify your book's source repository on GitHub using the `edit` key under the configuration options in the `_output.yml` file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter's source file. 

Read more about the features of this output format here:

https://pkgs.rstudio.com/bookdown/reference/gitbook.html

Or use:

```{r eval=FALSE}
?bookdown::gitbook
```
